# Avery's Website

## Project Overview

Avery and Zack are building a fun website [designed by Avery](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J_DF2ThPPtBgEy11wlBtsiFE9gB7u91YzIal7KWNUiA/edit#slide=id.g294782bd843_0_628) with mad libs, quizzes, and an assortment of additional fun things for Avery and her friends to do.

### Completed Work
1. `Mad Libs.ipynb` contains fully functional and interactive mad libs, all coded by Avery. Run the notebook and enjoy a few Mad Libs!
2. Website Design - Avery has a [draft design document](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J_DF2ThPPtBgEy11wlBtsiFE9gB7u91YzIal7KWNUiA/edit#slide=id.g294782bd843_0_628) in Google Slides

## Tasks
1. Write `Quizzes.ipynb`, which should mirror `Mad Libs.ipynb` by providing examples of how to code up simple but interactive quizzes.
2. Build a basic `dash` application for Mad Libs. Zack got started by adding `mad_libs_app.py` with a very poor quality, but functional, application which Avery can modify until it is acceptable.
3. Build a [basic `dash` application](https://dash.plotly.com/tutorial) for Quizzes. Start by copy/pasting your `mad_libs_app.py` code and removing all Mad Lib specific logic. 
4. Use [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp) to design the specific layout of your webpage, remembering to leave space for tabs and windows to toggle to and interact with your Mad Libs and Quizzes.
5. Put it all together - write a new `dash` application that contains all the functionality of your Mad Libs and Quizzes dash apps, and that looks like your HTML outline. 
6. Serve your new website to the world!! We're going to deploy our new `dash` application to a web server all Avery's friends can access using [Render](https://github.com/thusharabandara/dash-app-render-deployment). Zack will make an account, pay any fees necessary, and help you set up the Github repo they talk about in the tutorial. This should be a no-code task, just a few clicks in our [Render dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/) and we should be good to go.
